# Churn-Analysis
Analysis for Churn rate of Telecom Company with EDA on a data set to determine the pattern, plans, and prediction if they would churn or not in the future.
# Churn Analysis For Telecom Company 
## Project Description 
In this project we will make a customer churn analysis for telecom company and we will make a churn prediction. Churners are person who quit a company service. Companies should be able to predit the behavior of customer in order to reduce customer churn rate. THis project focus on carious machine learning techniques for predicting customer churn through models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Suport Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree, where we will compare the performance of these models. 
## Dataset Description 
This dataset has 7043 contaion 20 columns, namely: 
- customerID
- gender             
- SeniorCitizen       
- Partner            
- Dependents         
- tenure              
- PhoneService      
- MultipleLines      
- InternetService    
- OnlineSecurity    
- OnlineBackup      
- DeviceProtection  
- TechSupport       
- StreamingTV        
- StreamingMovies   
- Contract           
- PaperlessBilling  
- PaymentMethod      
- MonthlyCharges    
- TotalCharges       
- Churn
## Business Understanding 
- Problem : The Telecom Company waht to know the churn rate, and make a strategy to prevent customer churn 
- Goals : Find churn rate, and business startegy 
- Objective : Churn Analysis and churn prediction 
## Result 
Telecom Company neede to have a clear view through the customer to can provide customer offers to make them stay in the service. The churn prevention can be give a better result and performed by using machine learning techniques. In the modeling we was do we will use Suport Vector Machine (SVM) with 72% precision value as a prediction model.
